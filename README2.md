** Release notes**
3.0.5-ESS-SNAPSHOT

* modified apduBuf length for both short and extended cases to 1462.
* set le value for extended cases to Short.MAX_VALUE when le == 0x0000.
* modified buffer length in AsymmetricCipherImpl to add 1 in MODE_ENCRYPT.
* modified some unit test cases corresponding to the above changes.


**Please note** that we moved our code repository from Google Code to GitHub.

jCardSim is an open source simulator for Java Card, v.2.2/3.0.5:

* `javacard.framework.*`
* `javacard.framework.security.*`
* `javacardx.crypto.*`

Key Features:

* Rapid application prototyping
* Simplifies unit testing (5 lines of code)

```java
// 1. create simulator
CardSimulator simulator = new CardSimulator();

// 2. install applet
AID appletAID = AIDUtil.create("F000000001");
simulator.installApplet(appletAID, HelloWorldApplet.class);

// 3. select applet
simulator.selectApplet(appletAID);

// 4. send APDU
CommandAPDU commandAPDU = new CommandAPDU(0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00);
ResponseAPDU response = simulator.transmitCommand(commandAPDU);

// 5. check response
assertEquals(0x9000, response.getSW());
```

* Emulation of Java Card Terminal, ability to use `javax.smartcardio`
* APDU scripting (scripts are compatible with `apdutool` from Java Card Development Kit)
* Simplifies verification tests creation (Common Criteria)

### What is the difference from Oracle Java Card Development Kit simulator?

* **Implementation of javacard.security.***

  One of the main differences is the implementation of `javacard.security.*`: the current version is analogous to an NXP JCOP 31/36k card. For example, in jCardSim we have support for on-card `KeyPair.ALG_EC_F2M/ALG_RSA_CRT` key generation. Oracle's simulator only supports `KeyPair.ALG_RSA` and `KeyPair.ALG_EC_FP`, which are not supported by real cards.

* **Execution of Java Card applications without converting into CAP**

  jCardSim can work with class files without any conversions. This allows us to simplify and accelerate the development and writing of unit tests.

* **Simulator API**

  jCardSim has a simple and usable API, which also allows you to work with the simulator using `javax.smartcardio.*`.

* **Cross-platform**

  jCardSim is completely written in Java and can therefore be used on all platforms which support Java (Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc).

### How to help jCardSim?

* Join the team of jCardSim developers.
* Try out [DexProtector](http://dexprotector.com). The product is designed for strong and robust protection of Android applications against reverse engineering and modification.
* Licel has one more product you may be interested in - [Stringer Java Obfuscator](https://jfxstore.com/stringer). This tool provides all the features you need to comprehensively protect your Java applications.
